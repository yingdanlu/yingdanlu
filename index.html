<p>Welcome to my home page! My name is Yingdan Lu; I am an Assistant Professor of <a href="https://communication.northwestern.edu/academics/communication-studies/index.html">Communication Studies</a> in the School of Communication at <a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/">Northwestern University</a>. I am the director of the <a href="https://www.comaplab.org">Computational Media and Politics Lab</a>, a co-director of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/cmmclab">Computational Multimodal Communication Lab</a>, a core faculty in Northwestern's <a href="https://mts.northwestern.edu/">Media, Technology, and Society (MTS)</a> and <a href="https://tsb.northwestern.edu/">Technology and Social Behavior (TSB)</a> PhD programs, and affiliated with the <a href="https://polcomm.northwestern.edu/">Center for Communication & Public Policy</a> and <a href="https://www.hci.northwestern.edu/">Center for Human-Computer Interaction + Design</a>.

<p>My research focuses on two areas: <b>the role of digital technologies in authoritarian politics</b>, and <b>multimodal communication across different contexts</b>. My work has been published in leading peer-reviewed journals, including <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>, <i>American Journal of Political Science</i>, <i>Political Communication</i>, <i>New Media & Society</i>, and <i>Human–Computer Interaction</i>, as well as in peer-reviewed conference proceedings such as the <i>ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW)</i>.

<p>As a computational social scientist, my past and ongoing research has focused on advancing computational methods through the development of new frameworks analyzing multimodal data such as <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10584609.2024.2317951">images</a> and <a href="https://www.aup-online.com/content/journals/10.5117/CCR2022.2.002.LU">videos</a>, the analysis of <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2420607122">cross-lingual digital communication</a>, and the promotion of <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10584609.2020.1765914">mixed-method research</a>.</p>

I received my Ph.D. in <a href="http://comm.stanford.edu">Communication at Stanford University</a> in 2023, advised by Professor <a href="http://jenpan.com">Jennifer Pan</a>, where I also earned a Ph.D. minor in <a href="https://politicalscience.stanford.edu/">Political Science</a>, and a M.A. degree from <a href="https://ceas.stanford.edu/">Center of East Asian Studies</a>. I obtained my B.A. degree from the <a href="http://www.tsjc.tsinghua.edu.cn/">School of Journalism and Communication</a> at Tsinghua University.
